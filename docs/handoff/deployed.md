# Deployed State

## Current environments

- GitHub Actions runs canonical C# and Godot verification, structured-text formatting, Markdown lint, and standards validation on pull requests and `main`.
- `main` branch protection strictly requires the GitHub Actions `Canonical verification` check for all actors, including administrators.
- Force pushes and branch deletion are disabled for `main`; pull request #3 and its post-merge workflows are the initial green deployment evidence.
